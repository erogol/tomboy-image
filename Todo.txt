1. Error Messaging/Reporting
2. Undo/Redo for Deleting Images
3. Image sync (Why can't sync now? Because in Note:
                public string Text
		{
			get {
				SynchronizeText ();
				return data.Text;
			}
			set {
				data.Text = value;
				SynchronizeBuffer ();
			}
		}
My approach of appending data to the harddisk file won't change the result of Note.Text

4. Web Image Async Download
5. Elegant display for "can't be loaded" images
6. More functional ImageWidget
