1. Error Messaging/Reporting
2. Undo/Redo for Deleting Images
3. Image sync (Why can't sync now? Because in Note:
                public string Text
		{
			get {
				SynchronizeText ();
				return data.Text;
			}
			set {
				data.Text = value;
				SynchronizeBuffer ();
			}
		}
My approach of appending data to the harddisk file won't change the result of Note.Text

4. Web Image Async Download
5. Show Image Info in the ImageWidget's context menu.


Known issues:
1) Can't sync
2) If we delete the image with some other texts, the undo/redo DeleteImageAction isn't correctly implemented.
3) If we insert images consecutively, then they'll be loaded in reverse sequence next time. Or if we do undo/redo after the consecutive insertion, the sequence will also be reversed.
The reason is due to we insert multiple images to the same offset.
