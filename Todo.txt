1. Error Messaging/Reporting
2. Undo/Redo for Deleting Images (done.)
3. Image sync (Why can't sync now? Because in Note:
                public string Text
		{
			get {
				SynchronizeText ();
				return data.Text;
			}
			set {
				data.Text = value;
				SynchronizeBuffer ();
			}
		}
My approach of appending data to the harddisk file won't change the result of Note.Text

4. Web Image Async Download
5. Show Image Info in the ImageWidget's context menu.
6. Add a "Compress Images" menu item in Tool menu. Warn the quality loss at first time, then remember user's choice of whether warn next time.
7. Add a tutorial note, then set preference of 'HelpNoteAdded' to true.

Known issues:
1) Can't sync
NoteConvert.cs, Ln61, 

const string noteContentRegex = @"^<note-content(\s+version=""(?<contentVersion>[^""]*)"")?\s*((/>)|(>(?<innerContent>.*)</note-content>))$";
Match m = Regex.Match (note.XmlContent, noteContentRegex, RegexOptions.Singleline);

the web sync service just read note.XmlContent (but not the physical file content). And XmlContent is generated as:
	NoteBufferArchiver.Deserialize (buffer, value);
And NoteBufferArchiver.Deserialize will only serialize tags in buffer.TagTable.

2) If we delete the image with some other texts, the undo will cause the selection range expand to N extra chars, where N is the # of deleted images.

3) No Gtk.Stock icon in Ubuntu 10.10, (Tomboy is the same)
